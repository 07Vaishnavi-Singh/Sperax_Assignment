# Crypto-Portfolio App

## Project Overview

The Crypto-Portfolio App is a comprehensive web application designed to help cryptocurrency enthusiasts manage and monitor their digital asset holdings. This single-page application (SPA) offers a user-friendly interface for tracking token balances, historical data, and performing common cryptocurrency operations.

## Key Features

### 1. Wallet Integration
Users can connect their preferred cryptocurrency wallet (such as MetaMask) directly to the app. For those who prefer not to connect a wallet, there's an option to input a wallet address manually, providing flexibility in how users interact with the app.

### 2. Customizable Token Watch List
The heart of the app is its watch list feature. Users can add any ERC-20 token to their personal watch list by entering the token's contract address. The app then fetches and displays real-time balance information for each added token.

### 3. Historical Balance Tracking
Beyond current balances, the app provides historical balance data for each token. A built-in date range selector allows users to view how their token holdings have changed over time, offering valuable insights into their portfolio's performance.

### 4. Token Allowance Checker
For users engaged in DeFi protocols, the allowance checker is a crucial security feature. It allows users to view and manage the spending allowances they've granted to various smart contracts, helping to maintain control over their assets.

### 5. Token Transfer Functionality
The app includes a straightforward interface for transferring tokens. Users can specify a recipient address and the amount of tokens to send, streamlining the process of moving assets.

### 6. Data Visualization
To make complex data more accessible, the app employs a variety of visual representations. Charts and graphs illustrate historical balance trends, while tables provide detailed breakdowns of current holdings and allowances.

## Technical Implementation

The app is built using modern web technologies to ensure a responsive and efficient user experience:

- **React.js**: Powers the frontend, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **ethers.js**: Facilitates interaction with the Ethereum blockchain, handling tasks like wallet connections and token transfers.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling, allowing for a clean, customizable design.
- **recharts**: Implements the data visualization components, creating clear and informative charts.

## Future Enhancements

We're constantly working to improve the Crypto-Portfolio App. Planned future enhancements include:

- Integration with additional blockchain networks beyond Ethereum.
- Advanced portfolio analytics and performance metrics.
- Mobile app version for on-the-go portfolio management.
